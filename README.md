## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

To create my backdrop, I copied a code sequence from my work called FA320 Breath onto a new sketch.  I apply a new skill: tap the variable with two fingers and rename the symbol.  This simultaneously changes all of the variables in my setup function area for the whole project, removing any room for errors.  I altered all the original names to belong with â€˜Time Goes By So Slowlyâ€™ by Madonna because the song repeats in my head when I think of the word TIME.  Now, the code looks like a written song with the repetition of the caption in the code. I altered the circles' sizes, positions, colours, outlines and movements.  I crave for the circles to keep looping around on repeat instead of having them leave the canvas area.  I mess around with ChatGPT for the first time.  I asked how to repeat my circle's movements across the page without using a loop.  To my delight, it gave me a solution quickly by adding brackets and percentage symbols with width and height. Next, I wanted to know how to make 300 lines move randomly with different colours to create a feeling of busy chaos.  These lines look like confetti at a party in Madonnaâ€™s music video. Again, ChatGPT gave me a very easy-to-understand solution by drawing lines using the random function in movement and colour. Finally, I wanted a small circle to rotate clockwise, presenting time around the radius of the background.  I employ ChatGPT to write a code using minimum, height, and width divided by 2-20.  Having one circle rotate in a constant direction represents the inevitability of time; however, the random moving circles behind create unpredictability. I enjoyed using ChatGPT to create exactly what I wanted in the design.  It made the experience enjoyable. I have more control over the creative process with this extra assistance.
